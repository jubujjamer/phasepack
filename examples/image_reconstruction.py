"""
This script will create phaseless measurements from a test image, and
then recover the image using phase retrieval methods.  We now describe
the details of the simple recovery problem that this script implements.

                        Recovery Problem
This script loads a test image, and converts it to grayscale.
Measurements of the image are then obtained by applying a linear operator
to the image, and computing the magnitude (i.e., removing the phase) of
the linear measurements.

                      Measurement Operator
Measurement are obtained using a linear operator, called 'A', that
obtains masked Fourier measurements from an image.  Measurements are
created by multiplying the image (coordinate-wise) by a 'mask,' and then
computing the Fourier transform of the product.  There are 8 masks,
each of which is an array of binary (+1/-1) variables. The output of
the linear measurement operator contains the Fourier modes produced by
all 8 masks.  The measurement operator, 'A', is defined as a separate
function near the end of the file.  The adjoint/transpose of the
measurement operator is also defined, and is called 'At'.

                        Data structures
PhasePack assumes that unknowns take the form of vectors (rather than 2d
images), and so we will represent our unknowns and measurements as a
1D vector rather than 2D images.

                     The Recovery Algorithm
The image is recovered by calling the method 'solve_phase_retrieval', and
handing the measurement operator and linear measurements in as arguments.
A struct containing options is also handed to 'solve_phase_retrieval'.
The entries in this struct specify which recovery algorithm is used.

For more details, see the Phasepack user guide.
